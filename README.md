# Car_Dekho_Data_Analysis
# Car Price Prediction 

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the selling price of a car based on various features such as the car's make, model, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and owner \
#project Tasks:-
Pre-processing the data.\
Missing Value Treatment \
Outlier Treatment if required \
Feature Scaling \
Encoding or any other technique to make categorial to Numerical data\
Do extensive exploratory data analysis before creating the model.
Write the detailed conclusions from the analysis. \

1. Data Pre-processing
    - Missing Value Treatment
    - Outlier Treatment
    - Feature Scaling
    - Encoding Categorical Data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
    - Correlation Analysis
    - Pair Plots

3. Detailed Analysis and Conclusions

## Key Findings
- **Significant Features**: [List features based on p-value]
- **Assumptions**: [Verification of assumptions]

## Conclusion
The linear regression model provides a reasonable prediction of car prices with acceptable error margins. Further improvement can be achieved by including more relevant features or using advanced modeling techniques.

## Usage
To use this model, ensure all dependencies are installed and the dataset is properly formatted. Follow the steps in the `car_price_prediction.ipynb` script to retrain and evaluate the model.
