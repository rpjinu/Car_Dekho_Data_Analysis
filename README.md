# Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the selling price of a car based on various features such as the car's make, model, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and owner type using linear regression.
#project Tasks:-
Pre-processing the data.\
Missing Value Treatment \
Outlier Treatment if required \
Feature Scaling \
Encoding or any other technique to make categorial to Numerical data\
Do extensive exploratory data analysis before creating the model.
Write the detailed conclusions from the analysis. \
Identify the variables you think are the most important ones.\
Splitting the dataset into train and test sets (if required).\
Apply the algorithm which you have learnt, i.e., Linear Regression.\
Check if the assumptions of the linear regression are meeting or not.\
Remove the unwanted feature from the model by seeing the P-Value. \
At the end, write the detailed analysis and the behavior you saw from the experiments. \
Finding the best performing model using the R Squared, Adjusted R Squared, F-Test, Mean Squared error (MSE), Root mean squared error (RMSE), Mean absolute error (MAE), and Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)

## Key Findings
- **Significant Features**: [List features based on p-value]
- **Model Performance**: [Detailed metrics]
- **Assumptions**: [Verification of assumptions]

## Conclusion
The linear regression model provides a reasonable prediction of car prices with acceptable error margins. Further improvement can be achieved by including more relevant features or using advanced modeling techniques.

## Usage
To use this model, ensure all dependencies are installed and the dataset is properly formatted. Follow the steps in the `car_price_prediction.ipynb` script to retrain and evaluate the model.
